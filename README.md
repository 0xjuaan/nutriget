# Nutriget- All your nutritional data, meaningfully displayed in one place.

This is a work in progress.

# Some of the TODO's
- Change meal_id in database from autoincrement to random hexadec string
- add proper custom css for all components
- in the menu for creating a meal from scratch, allow users to hover over the card to see more data other than calories
