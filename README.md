This app is my final project for harvard's online course 'CS50'. 


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Here is a link to the [ultimate resource](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) that helped me in the project.
