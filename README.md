# Nutriget- All your nutritional data, meaningfully displayed in one place.

This is a work in progress. 

Used API from [Nutritionix](https://www.nutritionix.com/business/api). 

Here is a link to the [ultimate resource](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) that helped me in this project.

# Some of the TODO's
-Switch db from sqlite to prisma+supabase
- Make app look nice with better css
- Future Features: User chooses what macros they want to hide, User can add+delete meals straight from /history page
