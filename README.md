# Nutriget- All your nutritional data, meaningfully displayed in one place.

This is a work in progress.

Here is a link to the [ultimate resource](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) that helped me in this project.

# Some of the TODO's
- Change meal_id in database from autoincrement to random unique hexadec string (security)
- add proper custom css for all components
- allow users to hover over meal cards to see more data other than calories (like sugar, carbs, fat ...)
